## CHANGELOG

### 1.0.0
First release by SEG0C.
It isn't optimized and there are some errors on the calculations.
A lot of code is duplicated.
There are 5 executables that do different things.

### 2.0.0
Second release by SEG0C.
There are some new tools and some optimizations, but it doesn't replace version 1.0.0.

### 3.0.0
Release by Lilz.
Now Mikai is rewritten from scratch using the features
of C language (structures).
The calculations are now fixed.
However the library levels aren't independent of each other.

### 4.0.0
Mikai is now well documented (doxygen) and libmikai is easily usable by everyone.
libmikai is finished and stable.
Now libmikai uses uint32 data.
Mikai executable is now distributed as an AppImage file, but it's still in beta and should be rewritten in another language that is more
easy to maintain.

### 4.0.1
Fixed problem in key calculation
